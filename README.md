# EHP Proof Tracer

A computational tool for tracing calculations and mathematical inference in EHP exact sequences for unstable homotopy groups of spheres.

## Goal

The project separates mathematical theorem knowledge, explicit facts, the generic inference engine, and algebraic calculation.

```text
actual mathematical need
↓
minimum representation
↓
explicit fact / domain rule when needed
↓
existing generic inference engine
```

Important boundaries:

```text
representation != typing != theorem knowledge
structural equality != mathematical equality
```

The implementation strategy is to formalize only the minimum theorem consequences required by concrete homotopy-group calculations while preserving explicit provenance.

# Concrete branch through Proposition 5.1

Phase 49 derives:

```text
H injective
Δ=0
H surjective
H isomorphism
↓
η₂ = unique H-preimage of ι₃
↓
H(η₂)=ι₃
↓
π_3^2=Z{η₂}
```

Phase 50 derives:

```text
[ι₂,ι₂]=±2η₂
Δ(ι₅)=±2η₂
Ker(E)=Z{2η₂}
E surjective
↓
π_4^3=Z/2{η₃}
```

Phase 54 connects the higher η-family:

```text
η_n=E^(n-2)η₂
η₃=Eη₂
↓
E^(n-3)η₃=η_n
↓
π_{n+1}^n=Z/2{η_n}
```

Phase 55 integrates the finite-dimensional Proposition 5.1 result:

```text
π_3^2=Z{η₂}
H(η₂)=ι₃
Δ(ι₅)=±2η₂
π_{n+1}^n=Z/2{η_n}
↓
Toda Proposition 5.1 finite-dimensional result
```

The stable conclusion `(G_1;2)=Z/2{η}` remains deferred.

# Phase 56: Toda (5.2)

Phase 56 implements:

```text
η₂∘- : π_i^3 ≅ π_i^2
(i≥3)
```

via:

```text
i≥3
↓
π_{i-1}^1=0

H(η₂)=ι₃
↓
Prop.4.4, n=2, α=η₂
↓
Φ: π_{i-1}^1 ⊕ π_i^3 ≅ π_i^2

Φ|_{π_i^3}(γ)=η₂∘γ
↓
η₂∘- : π_i^3 ≅ π_i^2
```

No generic direct-sum simplifier or generic isomorphism-restriction framework was added.

# Phase 57: Toda Lemma 5.2

For:

```text
α ∈ π_i(S^3)
2α = 0
β ∈ {η₃,2ι₄,Eα}_1
```

the canonical conclusions are:

```text
H(β)=E²α
2β=η₃∘Eα∘η_{i+1}
β∈π_{i+2}^3
Δ(E²α)=0
```

The implementation uses `η_{i+1}`. The proof-ending occurrence of `η_{i+2}` is not used because it is incompatible with the typing and with the following `α=η₃` specialization.

## Phase 57 dependency

```text
Lemma 4.5
Proposition 2.6
Δ(ι₅)=±2η₂
Proposition 1.4
Proposition 1.3
Corollary 3.7
Toda (2.1)
Proposition 5.1 finite-dimensional result
```

Only the minimum consequences required by Lemma 5.2 are formalized.

## Hopf branch

```text
2α=0
↓ Lemma 4.5
2ι₃∘α=0

Proposition 2.6
↓
H(β) ∈ -Δ^-1(η₂∘2ι₃)∘E²α

Δ(ι₅)=±2η₂
↓
Δ^-1(2η₂)=±ι₅

integration
↓
H(β)=E²α
```

## Double-value branch

```text
β∈{η₃,2ι₄,Eα}_1
↓ Proposition 1.4
2β∈η₃∘E{2ι₃,α,2ι_i}

↓ Proposition 1.3
2β∈η₃∘-{2ι₄,Eα,2ι_{i+1}}_1

↓ Corollary 3.7
explicit representative
```

Indeterminacy vanishes through:

```text
γ∈π_{i+2}(S⁴)
↓ Toda (2.1)
E(η₃∘γ∘2ι_{i+2})=0
↓ Lemma 4.5, n=4 injectivity
η₃∘γ∘2ι_{i+2}=0
```

and the final conclusion is:

```text
2β=η₃∘Eα∘η_{i+1}
```

Bracket typing also yields `β∈π_{i+2}^3`, and the Hopf relation gives `Δ(E²α)=0`.

# Phase 58: Toda (5.3) ν′ consequence

Phase 58 specializes the already-derived Lemma 5.2 result. The Phase 57 proof chain is not reimplemented.

The starting membership is:

```text
ν′∈{η₃,2ι₄,η₄}_1
```

This is a membership statement: `ν′` is chosen as an element of the indexed Toda bracket. The bracket itself is not identified structurally with `ν′`.

The specialization is:

```text
α=η₃
i=4
β=ν′
```

Using the independently derived:

```text
π_4^3=Z/2{η₃}
↓
2η₃=0
```

Phase 58-3 derives the raw Lemma 5.2 specialization:

```text
ν′∈π_6^3
H(ν′)=E²η₃
2ν′=η₃∘Eη₃∘η₅
```

## Hopf-value normalization

The existing η-family definitions give the concrete Phase 58 bridge:

```text
E²η₃=η₅
```

and generic equality transitivity gives:

```text
H(ν′)=E²η₃
E²η₃=η₅
↓
H(ν′)=η₅
```

## Double-value normalization

The concrete η-family bridge gives:

```text
Eη₃=η₄
```

The existing generic composition-preservation rules are applied once:

```text
Eη₃=η₄
↓ right composition by η₅
Eη₃∘η₅=η₄∘η₅

↓ left composition by η₃
η₃∘(Eη₃∘η₅)
=
η₃∘(η₄∘η₅)
```

and generic equality transitivity gives:

```text
2ν′=η₃∘Eη₃∘η₅
↓
2ν′=η₃∘η₄∘η₅
```

The composition-preservation rules are repeatable `Relation → Relation` rules, so the Phase 58 representative flow applies them one-shot with `find_inference_match()` / `apply_inference_match()` instead of putting them into unrestricted fixed-point closure.

## Structural η-name boundary

The existing concrete η-family constructor uses:

```text
η_4
η_5
```

for concrete indices `n>=4`, while the Toda (5.3) branch uses canonical displayed elements:

```text
η₄
η₅
```

Phase 58 does not change the constructor globally. Dedicated narrow bridges validate dimension / source / target / generator identity and produce the canonical concrete conclusion.

No generic η-name normalizer is added.

# Next development boundary

Phase 58 is complete.

The next Phase should first inspect the next concrete source statement and its dependencies before choosing a new representation or general framework.

```text
next concrete Toda consequence
↓
source dependency analysis
↓
current representation compatibility
↓
minimum implementation
```

Stable `(G_1;2)=Z/2{η}`, a general stable homotopy-group model, generic Toda-bracket coset algebra, and generic normalization remain deferred until a concrete proof branch requires them.
