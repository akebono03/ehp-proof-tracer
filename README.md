# EHP Proof Tracer

A computational tool for tracing calculations in EHP exact sequences
for unstable homotopy groups of spheres.

## Goal

The long-term goal is to build a proof tracer that explains how
homotopy groups of spheres are determined from:

* EHP exact sequences
* composition relations
* Toda brackets
* Steenrod operations
* known element orders and relations
* literature references

The current algebra layer is designed to work with finitely generated
abelian groups, including both free and torsion components.

---

## Current status

The project has progressed from finite-group enumeration to
presentation-based calculations for finitely generated abelian groups.

Groups of the form

```text
Z^r ⊕ finite torsion
```

can be handled by the same algebra layer.

The current calculation pipeline is:

```text
group presentation
↓
homomorphism matrix
↓
integer lattice
↓
Hermite / Smith normal form
↓
kernel / image / cokernel
↓
exact sequence
↓
quotient / image structure
↓
EHP exactness
```

Finite-group enumeration is retained as an independent reference
implementation for testing presentation-based calculations.

---

## Current features

### Homotopy group data

* Load homotopy groups and generators from `data/sphere.csv`
* Represent group generators and their orders
* Construct E, H, and P maps from EHP data
* Keep homotopy-theoretic generator information separate from the
  abstract abelian-group calculation layer

---

### Finitely generated abelian groups

The algebra layer supports groups such as:

```text
0
Z
Z^2
Z/2
Z/4
Z/2 ⊕ Z/4
Z ⊕ Z/2
Z ⊕ Z/4
```

The intended general form is

```text
Z^r ⊕ Z/d1 ⊕ ... ⊕ Z/ds.
```

---

### Homomorphisms

Homomorphisms are represented by integer matrices.

The implementation supports:

* finite → finite
* finite → free
* free → finite
* free → free
* mixed → mixed
* non-diagonal maps
* zero groups and zero maps

For a homomorphism

```text
f : G → H
```

the presentation-based algebra layer can compute:

```text
Ker(f)
Im(f)
Coker(f)
```

as abstract finitely generated abelian groups.

---

### Presentation-based calculations

General group calculations use integer presentations and lattices.

The main calculation path is:

```text
relation matrix
↓
integer lattice
↓
Hermite normal form
↓
Smith normal form
↓
abelian-group structure
```

This avoids the need to enumerate all elements when free components
such as `Z` are present.

---

### Finite-group reference calculations

For small finite abelian groups, the earlier enumeration-based
algorithms are retained.

They can explicitly compute:

* group elements
* subgroups
* quotient cosets
* kernels
* images

These algorithms are used as an independent reference implementation
for cross-checking the presentation-based calculations.

---

### Subgroups

Finite subgroups can be represented as structured objects containing:

* ambient group
* elements
* generators
* order
* abstract structure

Examples:

```text
()       -> 0
(2,)     -> Z/2
(4,)     -> Z/4
(2, 2)   -> Z/2 ⊕ Z/2
(2, 4)   -> Z/2 ⊕ Z/4
```

---

### Quotient groups

For finite groups, the program can explicitly:

* construct quotient groups
* enumerate cosets
* compute quotient-group order
* compute quotient-group structure
* verify induced quotient maps

For general finitely generated abelian groups,
quotient structures can also be computed from presentations without
enumerating cosets.

---

### Exact sequences

For

```text
A --f--> B --g--> C
```

the program can compute:

```text
Im(f)
Ker(g)
B / Im(f)
Im(g)
```

and test exactness:

```text
Im(f) = Ker(g).
```

This works for sequences containing free components.

For example,

```text
Z --×2--> Z --mod 2--> Z/2
```

is correctly detected as exact because

```text
Im(×2) = 2Z
Ker(mod 2) = 2Z.
```

The program also tracks the first-isomorphism-theorem relation

```text
B / Im(f) ≅ Im(g)
```

as an abstract group-structure relation.

Exactness and abstract group isomorphism are treated as distinct
concepts.

---

### First isomorphism theorem

For a homomorphism

```text
f : G → H
```

the finite-group layer can explicitly construct and verify

```text
G / Ker(f) ≅ Im(f).
```

The general presentation layer computes the corresponding abstract
group structures without requiring full element enumeration.

---

### Extension candidates

For a finite short exact sequence

```text
0 → A → B → C → 0
```

the middle group `B` is not necessarily uniquely determined.

For example,

```text
0 → Z/2 → B → Z/2 → 0
```

allows both

```text
Z/4
Z/2 ⊕ Z/2
```

as possible middle groups.

The program can:

* enumerate finite abelian group structures of the required order
* construct abstract candidate groups
* test whether a candidate contains a subgroup isomorphic to `A`
* test whether the corresponding quotient is isomorphic to `C`
* return valid middle-group candidates

The current extension-candidate enumeration remains focused on finite
abelian groups.

---

### EHP calculations

For an EHP segment

```text
π_{n+k-1}(S^{n-1})
        --E-->
π_{n+k}(S^n)
        --H-->
π_{n+k}(S^{2n-1})
        --P-->
π_{n+k-2}(S^{n-1})
```

the program can:

* construct the E, H, and P homomorphisms
* compute images and kernels
* check exactness
* compute general abelian-group structures
* construct exact-sequence steps
* compare quotient and image structures
* infer possible finite middle-group structures from extension data

The EHP layer delegates general exact-sequence calculations to the
algebra layer.

---

## Verified examples

### Finite EHP example: n = 3, k = 5

For

```text
π_7(S^2)
  --E-->
π_8(S^3)
  --H-->
π_8(S^5)
  --P-->
π_6(S^2)
```

the program verifies

```text
Im(E) = Ker(H)
Im(H) = Ker(P).
```

It derives

```text
π_8(S^3):
  candidate = Z/2
```

and for the Hopf target:

```text
π_8(S^5):
  candidates =
    Z/8
    Z/2 ⊕ Z/4.
```

The known value

```text
π_8(S^5) = Z/8
```

is contained in the candidate set.

---

### Noncyclic finite example: n = 11, k = 18

The program verifies exactness for an example containing larger
noncyclic finite abelian groups.

For example,

```text
π_29(S^11)
≅ Z/8 ⊕ Z/4 ⊕ Z/2.
```

The general structure API verifies relationships such as

```text
Im(E)
≅ Z/2 ⊕ Z/2 ⊕ Z/4
```

and

```text
π / Im(E)
≅ Im(H)
≅ Z/2 ⊕ Z/2.
```

---

### General exact-sequence example

The presentation layer handles sequences involving free groups.

For example,

```text
Z --×2--> Z --mod 2--> Z/2
```

is exact, while

```text
Z --×2--> Z --mod 4--> Z/4
```

is not exact.

This provides the algebraic foundation required for EHP segments
containing free components.

---

## Architecture

The project separates general algebra from homotopy-theoretic data.

```text
proof / inference layer
        ↓
homotopy / EHP data layer
        ↓
abelian group algebra
        ↓
integer linear algebra
```

### Integer linear algebra

Responsible for:

* relation matrices
* integer lattices
* Hermite normal form
* Smith normal form

This layer has no knowledge of EHP sequences or homotopy groups.

### Abelian group algebra

Responsible for:

* finitely generated abelian groups
* homomorphisms
* kernels
* images
* cokernels
* subgroups
* quotients
* exact sequences
* extensions

This layer treats `E`, `H`, and `P` simply as group homomorphisms.

### Homotopy / EHP layer

Responsible for:

* homotopy-group data
* generator names
* construction of E, H, and P
* translating EHP data into group homomorphisms

### proof / inference layer

The proof / inference layer is being developed to derive and trace
mathematical relations from sources such as:

* composition relations
* Toda brackets
* Steenrod operations
* Hopf invariants
* stable-range results
* known element orders
* literature references

The distinction is intentional:

```text
derive a mathematical relation
```

and

```text
calculate its algebraic consequences
```

are separate responsibilities.

---

## Primary components

The algebra layer is not restricted to the 2-primary component.

Groups such as

```text
Z/2
Z/4
Z/3
Z/9
```

are all handled as ordinary finitely generated abelian groups.

The distinction between:

* classical EHP
* double EHP
* 2-primary data
* odd-primary data

belongs to the homotopy/inference layers rather than the core algebra
engine.

## Development status

* Phase 1: finite abelian group calculations — completed
* Phase 2: structured subgroup calculations — completed
* Phase 3: quotient groups, exact sequences, extensions, and EHP inference — completed
* Phase 4: presentation-based calculations with free components — completed
* Phase 5: proof / inference foundation — in progress

Phase 5 currently supports:

* structured homotopy expressions
* mathematical relations
* relation repositories and structural relation search
* proof steps and proofs
* kernel / image / cokernel proof steps
* exactness and EHP exactness proof construction
* explicit proof dependencies through premises
* conversion of known relations into proof steps
* relation-based inference steps
* relation source and note metadata in formatted proofs
* structured literature references with author, title, year, and locator
* inference from multiple mathematical relations
* inference combining relations with existing proof steps
* structured inference-rule metadata
* explicit distinction between proof-step categories and mathematical inference rules
* premise-pattern metadata for inference rules
* premise requirements based on proof-step category, statement type, and relation type
* multiple premise patterns for a single inference rule
* human-readable proof formatting

For example, an EHP exactness calculation can now be represented as:

```text
1. Im(E) ≅ 0
   [image computation]

2. Ker(H) ≅ 0
   [kernel computation]

3. Im(E) = Ker(H)
   [ehp exactness]
   Premises: 1, 2
```

Known mathematical relations can participate directly in proof
dependencies:

```text
1. 2η_3 = 0
   [relation]

2. η_3 has order dividing 2
   [relation]
   Premises: 1
```

Multiple known relations can be combined in a single inference:

```text
1. 2η_3 = 0
   [relation]

2. 2η_4 = 0
   [relation]

3. combined result
   [relation]
   Premises: 1, 2
```

The mathematical inference rule used by an inference step can also be
recorded explicitly:

```text
1. 2η_3 = 0
   [relation]

2. η_3 has order dividing 2
   [relation]
   Inference rule: zero relation implies order bound
   Premises: 1
```

This distinguishes:

```text
ProofRule
```

which describes the broad category of a proof step, from:

```text
InferenceRule
```

which describes the specific mathematical rule used to derive a
conclusion from its premises.

An inference rule can also describe the kinds of premises it expects.

For example:

```python
InferenceRule(
  name=(
    "zero relation implies "
    "order bound"
  ),
  premise_patterns=(
    PremisePattern(
      proof_rule=ProofRule.RELATION,
      statement_type=Relation,
      relation_type=RelationType.ZERO,
    ),
  ),
)
```

describes a rule that expects a proof step satisfying:

```text
ProofRule.RELATION
+
conclusion type = Relation
+
RelationType.ZERO
```

The premise-pattern model currently describes rule requirements only.
It does not yet check whether an actual `ProofStep` matches a
`PremisePattern`.

Relation sources can be represented as structured literature
references.

For example:

```text
Source: Toda — H. Toda, Composition Methods in Homotopy Groups of Spheres, 1962
```

The literature reference model can store:

```text
label
author
title
year
locator
```

while relation-specific mathematical notes, inference-step notes, and
inference-rule metadata remain separate.

---

## Current limitations

Some finite-group functionality still uses explicit element or subgroup
enumeration.

In particular, extension-candidate generation currently focuses on
finite abelian groups and relatively small examples.

The presentation layer can calculate algebraic consequences of known
homomorphisms, but it does not yet derive E/H/P formulas themselves
from Toda relations, composition relations, or other homotopy-theoretic
theorems.

The current proof / inference layer records explicitly constructed
dependencies, inference-rule metadata, and premise-pattern
specifications, but does not yet automatically:

* match a `ProofStep` against a `PremisePattern`
* determine whether an inference rule is applicable
* match internal expression structures
* bind pattern variables
* construct conclusions from inference rules
* select applicable relations
* select premise proof steps automatically
* recursively collect proof dependencies
* construct a proof DAG
* derive E/H/P formulas from homotopy-theoretic relations

These belong to later proof / inference phases.

---

## Project documentation

More detailed development and design notes are kept separately:

* `docs/development_log.md` — implementation history and Phase progress
* `docs/design.md` — design decisions and mathematical/computational rationale

---

## Tests

Run the complete test suite with:

```powershell
python -m pytest -v
```

At the completion of Phase 5-15:

```text
230 passed in 20.65s
```

The development log records test-suite results at each implementation
checkpoint.

---

## Next direction

The immediate next step is to make premise-pattern specifications
machine-checkable.

Phase 5-16 will introduce the minimum mechanism for comparing:

```text
PremisePattern
+
ProofStep
↓
match / no match
```

The first matching layer should remain intentionally small and use only
the information already represented by `PremisePattern`:

```text
proof_rule
statement_type
relation_type
```

Expression-level matching is a later concern.

For example, Phase 5-16 should be able to determine whether a proof
step satisfies a pattern such as:

```text
ProofRule.RELATION
+
conclusion type = Relation
+
RelationType.ZERO
```

without yet interpreting the internal expression structure of a
relation such as:

```text
mα = 0.
```

Possible later directions include:

* `PremisePattern` / `ProofStep` matching
* inference-rule applicability checks
* expression-level relation patterns
* pattern variables and variable binding
* conclusion construction
* automatic relation selection
* automatic premise selection
* composition relations
* Toda brackets
* integration of derived homotopy relations with EHP map data
* recursive proof dependency collection
* proof dependency graph construction
* literature-backed automatic proof tracing

The algebra layer remains independent of these higher-level
homotopy-theoretic inference mechanisms.
